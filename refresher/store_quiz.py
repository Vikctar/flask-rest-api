"""This coding exercise requires you to complete an implementation
of three methods of a class.
1. The __init__ method, which should take an argument, name. It should initialize
self.name to be the argument, and self.items to be an empty list
2. The add_item method, which should append a dictionary representing an item to the store's items property.
The dictionary should have keys name and price.
3. The stock_price method, which should add up each item price inside self.items to come up with a total
and return that."""


class Store:
    def __init__(self):

    # You'll need 'name' as an argument to this method.
    # Then, initialise 'self.name' to be the argument, and 'self.items' to be an empty list.


    def add_item(self, name, price):

    # Create a dictionary with keys name and price, and append that to self.items.

    def stock_price(self):
# Add together all item prices in self.items and return the total.
